# Day-8

KMeans Clustering which is performed on unlabelled data.
The steps I followed are:-
1. Imported the libraries, dropped unnecesary columns, standardized the data and used PCA to reduce the dimension to 2.
2. Then trained the model by using KMean Clustering method. Used the elbow method to select the optimal value of k. 4 and 6 seemed optimal but 6 had higher silouette value.
3. Observed the scatter plot for the clustering of the data points as well for 6 clusters.
